.. We want to tell how we setup the project and what we want to do.

.. .. code-block:: python

   from pelican import create_my_website

   create_my_website(auto_content=True)

.. Wow, that was easy.. Ok that was a lie. But let's document here how this
   site evolved using `Pelican <http://pelicam.com>`_.

.. Initial page
.. ------------
.. I downloaded Pelican and their theme suite, wrote a single article,
.. created a personal github pages project, connected my DNS.. and pushed
.. the project using :code:`make github`

.. One thing annoyed me already about this theme. It does not cover all rst
.. items. For example it does not have styling for inline code-blocks..
