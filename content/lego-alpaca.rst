:summary: A lego alpaca I reverse engineered and built.


For the birthday of my girlfriend I was looking for a LEGO alpaca since
she loves alpacas. (Un)fortunately, I could not find any LEGO alpaca set.
(except for the `minifig sized one <https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=65405pb03&name=Alpaca%20/%20Llama,%20Friends%20with%20Dark%20Azure%20Eyes,%20Black%20Nose,%20and%20Tan%20Muzzle%20Pattern&category=%5BAnimal,%20Land%5D#T=C>`_,
but that was not what I was looking for) So I decided to build one
myself. Since I had limited time, I decided to reverse engineer an
existing alpaca. I found a nice one on `Reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/lkb669/alpaca_forever/>`_:

   The original alpaca I found on Reddit.

I reverse engineered it, built it and created an instruction manual.
